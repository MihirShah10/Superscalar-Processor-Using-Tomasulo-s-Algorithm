# Superscalar-Processor-Using-Tomasulo-s-Algorithm

In this Research Project an approach to modify the existing Tomasulo’s Algorithm by combining it with Superscalar Instruction Dispatching 
techniques and to compare the Performance of the proposed design with existing Tomasulo’s Algorithm which issues one instruction per cycle
as well as an In-order Processor which consists of a Single ALU Unit and performs issuing and executing of instructions in-order.
